Minimal
========================

A barebones quick-to-start Symfony3 micro framework which can seamlessly grow into a larger, fully framework taking full advantage of Symfony Components and 3rd party bundles.

To Run:
----------------------------------

***Assuming PHP & Composer are installed.***

1) Git clone or copy to a project directory

2) In the project directory, install third party dependencies:

    $ composer up 

3) To verify install, from the parent directory, run the in-built PHP webserver:

    php -S localhost:8000 -t your_project_folder

Where your_project_name represents the project directory from step 1.

4) Start creating your Controllers and Services in the src/AppBundle folder.
